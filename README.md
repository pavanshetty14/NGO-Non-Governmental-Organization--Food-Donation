Would you like me to also **write the SQL schema file (`ngo_food.sql`)** so that anyone cloning your repo can directly import it?

give password

Got it üëç

By default, in XAMPP/WAMP, the MySQL root user has no password (just empty).

So in your connection.php, it should look like this:

$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";  // default is empty
$dbname = "ngo_food";


üëâ If you want to add a password (for security):

Open phpMyAdmin ‚Üí go to User accounts.

Edit the root@localhost user ‚Üí set a new password (e.g., 1234).

Then update your connection.php:

$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "1234";  // your new password
$dbname = "ngo_food";
